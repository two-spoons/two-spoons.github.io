## why post?

ruminating on the posts that claude hallucinated, with dates and content entirely figments of it's own weights. i elected to make my own in competition. demonstrably and evidently not the first one. i have staked no claim, disappointing.

## what's to come?

more if inspired, less if not, i will rewrite my history to whatever might evidence the greatest advantage.
